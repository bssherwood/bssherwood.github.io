I am a Howard Mid Career associate professor in Business Analytics at the <a href="https://business.ku.edu/">University of Kansas School of Business</a>. Broadly, my research area is in Statistics. Specifically, my research areas are
* Quantile regression, with a focus on penalized methods;
* Multiple response models, again with a focus on penalized methods;
* Applications of statistic to business problems, often guided by advising PhD students. 

My work with PhD students has included accounting for model selection uncertainty in beta regression, using Bayesian networks to predict PTSD for veterans, predicting bankrupcy for firms, and modeling the effects of blockbusters on crowdfunding platforms. My students are allowed flexibility to choose a path that interests them, but a student that works with should expect to develop new statistical methods, write code, and prove theorems about these methods. Typically I co-advise with other faculty, recently working with Professors <a href="https://pshenoy.ku.edu/">Prakash Shenoy</a>, <a href="https://business.ku.edu/people/karthik-srinivasan">Karthik Srinivasan</a>, and <a href="https://shaobo-li.github.io/">Shaobo Li</a>.
